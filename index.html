		<h1>The First Day</h1>
		<p>On the first day we started off my doing "Would You Rather" questions so we could get to know a little more about each other. Then, we introduced ourselves and played "Two Truths And a Lie" so we could learn even more about everybody. It was fun to just play around and have fun but then we got to work on Scratch.<hr /></p>
		<h1>Scratch</h1>
		<p>Scratch is a simple little website where you can create simple games. It is a good place to start for beginners. You can learn what all the different blocks of code do and use those in different ways to make fun games to mess around with. The cool part about Scratch is that you can see what other people make and how they made it. Here is a link to one of the games i made on Scratch.</p>

		<h1>Next</h1>
		<p>So after we were done on Scratch, we went on to start learning HTML, which I am using to make this site right now. HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language". Don't ask me what that means because I have NO idea. All I know is that it is what makes ever website on the internet and it's really cool. it can do alot of stuff, especially paired with CSS. And it can do <i>this</i> and <b>this</b> and <u>this</u> for starters.<hr /></p>
		<h1>CSS</h1>
		<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheet, basically makes stuff look really cool! It can make a moving block that can change color, turn into a circle, and go into the distance. It's just amazing.<hr /></p>
		<h1>The End</h1>
		<p>I had alot of fun at this coding camp and learned alot of new things. We learned all types of coding. HTML, CSS, and Python are some examples. I may make it sound like all we did was work, but actually we played around alot. But, I am glad I got to come and I thank everybody that helped me get to come.<hr /></p>
